This repository contains R and Python notebooks to accompany [An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/index.html) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.

The notebooks are written and tested in Google Colab. They should run in any Jupyter notebook environment, provided a Python and/or R kernel is installed.


## R coding labs
The R notebooks are taken from the [website of the University of Southern California](Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani), with some minor changes to improve readability and use in Google Colab.

### Online resources for learning R

#### Beginners
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), by the Big Guy which is the reference guide to using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- [Antroduction to data cleaning with R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf), by Edwin de Jonge and Mark van der Loo (CBS discussion paper)

#### Intermediate
- [Handson Machine Learning with R](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/)
- [The Art of R Programming](http://diytranscriptomics.com/Reading/files/The%20Art%20of%20R%20Programming.pdf) from No Starch Press

### Running R in Google Colab

Google Colab launches a Python 3 kernel by default. To create a new R notebook, use this URL: [https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#create=true&language=r](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#create=true&language=r)
